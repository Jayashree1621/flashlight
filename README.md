🔦 Flashlight Effect – Web Experiment with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

I recently built an interactive project that simulates a flashlight shining across a dark background. As the user moves the cursor (or finger on touch devices), a circular spotlight follows, revealing the hidden background beneath. It feels like holding a real flashlight over a surface — in this  case, an old newspaper page.

💡 What this project demonstrates:

Use of CSS variables (--spot-x, --spot-y, --spot-size) to dynamically update styles in real time.

Application of CSS radial gradients to create a smooth circular beam with transparent and dark layers.

JavaScript event handling (mousemove, touchmove) to track pointer positions and update the flashlight effect seamlessly.

Responsive design tweaks to ensure the effect works across desktop and mobile screens.

⚙️ Features included:
✔️ Interactive flashlight that follows the cursor
✔️ Adjustable beam size and opacity for customization
✔️ Option to toggle the flashlight on/off with keyboard or clicks
✔️ Background image integration for immersive visuals

🎯 Learning Outcomes:
This project deepened my understanding of:

Combining CSS + JS for creative UI effects

Leveraging DOM manipulation with custom CSS properties

Enhancing user experience through subtle yet engaging interactions

Writing clean, modular code across separate HTML, CSS, and JS files

✨ Even though it’s a small experiment, projects like this remind me how front-end development blends logic with creativity. It’s these little touches that can make digital experiences stand out.
