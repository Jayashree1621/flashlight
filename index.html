    <h1>Planets of the Solar System</h1>
    <p>Planets are celestial bodies that orbit a star, such as the Sun, and are massive enough to be shaped into a sphere but not massive enough to trigger nuclear fusion. Our solar system has eight planets, divided into two main types. The terrestrial planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars — are small, rocky, and dense with solid surfaces. The giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — are much larger and mostly made of gas or ice, often surrounded by numerous moons. Each planet rotates on its axis, causing day and night, and travels around the Sun in an orbit. Some planets, like Venus and Earth, have thick atmospheres, while others, like Mercury, have almost none. These planets vary in size, composition, temperature, and other characteristics, making each one unique in our solar system.
        Planets are remarkable celestial bodies that orbit stars, such as our Sun, and possess sufficient mass for their gravity to shape them into nearly spherical forms. Unlike stars, planets do not produce their own light through nuclear fusion; instead, they reflect the light of their parent star. The study of planets, known as planetary science, has fascinated humans for centuries, evolving from ancient observations to modern scientific exploration. In antiquity, planets were often identified as "wandering stars" because of their apparent movement across the sky compared to the fixed stars. Ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, meticulously recorded planetary positions, laying the foundation for astronomy and astrology. The development of the heliocentric model by Copernicus in the 16th century revolutionized our understanding of the solar system, placing the Sun at the center rather than Earth. Later, astronomers like Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler refined our knowledge, revealing planetary orbits and characteristics with unprecedented precision. Today, with advanced telescopes and space missions, we have extensive data on the planets in our solar system, as well as thousands of exoplanets beyond it, opening new frontiers for scientific discovery and exploration.

Our solar system consists of eight primary planets, traditionally divided into two main groups: the inner terrestrial planets and the outer giant planets. The terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are relatively small, dense, and rocky. They possess solid surfaces, often with significant geological activity, craters, mountains, and, in some cases, atmospheres. In contrast, the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are much larger and composed mainly of gases and ices. These giant planets often have extensive ring systems and numerous moons, displaying phenomena that are both visually striking and scientifically significant. Beyond these primary planets lie dwarf planets, such as Pluto, Eris, and Ceres, as well as smaller objects in the asteroid belt and Kuiper Belt, all contributing to the vast diversity of the solar system. Each planet is unique, exhibiting distinct characteristics in terms of size, composition, atmosphere, rotation, orbital dynamics, and potential to harbor life. Studying these planets not only helps us understand the formation and evolution of the solar system but also informs our search for habitable worlds beyond Earth.

The inner planets, or terrestrial planets, provide insight into rocky planet formation and the conditions necessary to support life. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is small and heavily cratered, with virtually no atmosphere to regulate temperature, resulting in extreme thermal variations between its day and night sides. Venus, similar in size to Earth, is enveloped in a dense atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the solar system. Earth, uniquely, supports life due to its balanced atmosphere, liquid water, magnetic field, and moderate temperatures. Mars, the Red Planet, has intrigued scientists for centuries due to its potential past presence of water, its polar ice caps, and the ongoing exploration by rovers and orbiters seeking signs of life and understanding its geological history. The diversity among these terrestrial planets highlights the range of conditions under which planets can exist, even within the same solar system.

This is a detailed start of the essay, written entirely in paragraphs. The next steps would cover the giant planets, dwarf planets, atmospheres, moons, rings, and exploration, eventually expanding to reach ~20,000 words.

I can continue by writing the next section on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the same paragraph style, with detailed descriptions of each.
